### Additions
* You can now handle all mouse clicks and not just the ones with the left mouse button.

### Fixes
* Fixed the mcmod.info file not containing any version information in the dev JAR.

### Notes
* Some changes to the mouse API will probably break your custom widgets and button handlers. Watch out for that when upgrading!
